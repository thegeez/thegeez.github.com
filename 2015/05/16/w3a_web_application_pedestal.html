  <div id="content"><h1 id="post-title">Web application with Pedestal</h1>16 May 2015

<p>As Frankie said, for web development in Clojure we
  should <a href="http://frankiesardo.github.io/posts/2014-12-15-give-pedestal-another-chance.html">give Pedestal another chance</a>. So I set out to build a user facing web
  application with <a href="http://pedestal.io">Pedestal</a>. To me a minimally useful user facing web application
  should have a database, templating, forms, authentication and
  authorization. And for development I like to get something
  I can click through as soon as possible, as well as having a
  dynamic development process from the REPL.
  The <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a">w3a</a> library
  and <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example">w3a-example</a> try to provide this, using
  Pedestal as foundation. </p>

<h2>w3a-example</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example">example application</a> is running on Heroku
  at <a href="https://w3a-example.herokuapp.com/">https://w3a-example.herokuapp.com</a>.
  The functionality is loosely inspired
  by <a href="http://restframework.herokuapp.com/">Django
  Rest Framework example application</a>, but the implementation is not. This means the example
  contains CRUD-like data pages, users accounts, forms, pagination and breadcrumb
  navigation. The interesting code in the w3a-example is in the
  <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/master/src/w3a/example/service.clj">service.clj</a> file.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>w3a
  uses <a href="https://github.com/stuartsierra/component">components</a>
  with Pedestal to organize the app and to provide an in-memory database
  for development and to leave out the jetty webserver during testing.
  Migrations and fixture loading are also components</p>

<h2>Data, links &amp; forms</h2>
<p>The basic parts of a page in a CRUD web application are data, links
  and maybe a form. The data is whatever the application is about, the
  links make it a web application and the form makes the
  application slightly more interesting than a static web page.</p>

<h2>w3a</h2>
<p>With w3a the aim is to be able to specify the data, links and forms
  as an EDN api first and then later decorate this with a template to
  serve HTML. To serve HTML the data is transformed
  with <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a>. The EDN
  api returns a 201 status for a created resource and a 400 status
  when something failed validation. This is not the functionality
  users expect when browsing through HTML pages, so w3a transforms those to 303 redirects and
  re-rendered form pages with the validation errors added. To aid the
  development of the EDN api a click-througable HTML version is
  served in browsers. This is available by appending
  the <a href="https://w3a-example.herokuapp.com/snippets/1?format=dev">?format=dev</a> parameter.</p>

<h2>context, context everywhere</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is claimed that web development in Clojure only
  requires the composition of libraries. While this is true, for me
  this is almost always a frustrating exercise. In particular when the
  composition requires composing database access, sessions and user
  authentication.<br /> In Pedestal everything goes through interceptors,
  which take the context as an argument. This <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/master/guides/documentation/service-context-reference.md">context</a> consists of the
  request, response and other user defined content. I have started to
  simple pass the context everywhere. In <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/6165f22ab50e50d06c396b8615730f41740efb94/src/w3a/example/service.clj#L121">link
  generators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/6165f22ab50e50d06c396b8615730f41740efb94/src/w3a/example/service.clj#L160">validation
  functions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/6165f22ab50e50d06c396b8615730f41740efb94/src/w3a/example/service.clj#L57">templating</a> and everywhere else.
  You could argue that this is not much better than global objects or
  injected bindings everywhere, but I prefer it as I always end up
  needing just a little part of the context somewhere deep down in the
  composition. To make using the context everywhere less verbose I use
  the <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a/blob/4d38f2dc17aa8532cc3ef0e494c64936666f689b/src/net/thegeez/w3a/interceptor.clj#L10">combine</a> function
  from <a href="http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/">Liberator</a>.</p>

<h2>Links and breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>Pedestal has great support for generating links, as the <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/master/guides/documentation/service-routing.md">routing
  table</a> doesn't just parse links to call the appropriate handler, it
  also
  has <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/master/guides/documentation/service-routing.md#url-generation">url
  generation</a> based on the routing table. This also makes it easy
  to define links as part of the data. For instance, the link to
  <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/6165f22ab50e50d06c396b8615730f41740efb94/src/w3a/example/service.clj#L358">edit a snippet</a> is only included in the data
when the user is logged in as the owner of a snippet. This would be
  awkward to do by constructing links out of strings everywhere.<br />
  In w3a the routing table is also used to generate <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a/blob/4d38f2dc17aa8532cc3ef0e494c64936666f689b/src/net/thegeez/w3a/link.clj#L29">breadcrumbs</a>. This
  makes it easy to quickly being able to click through the
  application, particularly early in development.</p>

<h2>Forms through bindings</h2>
<p>Defining and rendering forms with validations in w3a is done with
  bindings. The name is taken from the Go
  library <a href="https://github.com/macaron-contrib/binding">binding</a>.
  While it is <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/6165f22ab50e50d06c396b8615730f41740efb94/src/w3a/example/service.clj#L366">extensible</a>, it is currently very minimal. Also the way
  to define which data goes with which binding definition can be improved.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>For testing web applications in Clojure there are the <a href="https://github.com/xeqi/kerodon">Kerodon</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/xeqi/peridot">Peridot</a> libraries. They are both designed for use with Ring, but
  with some adjustments can be made to work with Pedestal to test the
  <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/master/test/w3a/example/html.clj">HTML</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/w3a-example/blob/master/test/w3a/example/edn.clj">EDN</a> functionality.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pedestal is indeed worth another look. For my use case for user
  facing web applications it is also a good foundation.</p>
