<p>Some time ago I came across a very tiny but potent program. It
  is a <a href="http://blog.aerojockey.com/post/iocccsim">flight simulator</a> in under 2kb of code. This program from 1998
  was written for the Obfuscated C contest by Carl Banks. In this program you fly a
  tiny airplane through a wireframe 3d world.</p>

<p>As I have little experience with 3d programming, I was curious to
  figure out how this program worked. Therefore I made a version in
  ClojureScript. In this edition you fly over my home town of
  Amsterdam, instead of Pittsburgh from the original. Here you can
  enjoy the layout of the canals rather than a sky full of
  skyscrapers as Amsterdam isn't really known for its skyline. There
  is also a row of windmills.</p>

<p>Obviously, it is not easy to figure out how a program works from
  obfuscated code. This <a href="https://forums.linuxgamecast.com/lgcbbs/discussion/7796/deobfuscate-the-carl-banks-flight-simulator-from-ioccc-1998-readable-clear-up-indented">partial de-obfuscated version</a> was very helpful
  in learning how to render the world with the airplane as the
  camera or viewpoint. I still haven't figured out how
  the flight mechanics of the plane work, so the ClojureScript version
  has a more arcade style of flying.</p>

<p>Evidently, all the rendering and controls can be handled by shoving
  all the math through a single matrix. I also did not manage to get
  that to work, so instead the program does a bit more math in
  separate steps. This means that the program does more calculations
  than necesarry. This makes your laptop fan spin, which sounds like
  the propellor of a tiny airplane, which is a feature.</p>

<p>Finally, the original program was skillfully fit into obfuscated C. With
  ClojureScript's advanced compilation with the Google Closure
  Compiler the <a href="/static/flight/cljs_flight.js">obfusciation</a> is provided for free.</p>
