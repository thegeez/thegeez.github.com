  <div id="content"><h1 id="post-title">A wiki made with Clojure, yada and Datomic
  Client</h1>04 Jan 2017

<p>At EuroClojure in Bratislava an unconference session was about
  Clojure and REST. At this
  session <a href="http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/">Liberator</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/juxt/yada">yada</a> were discussed by their
  authors. I have used Liberator previously, by not yada. A big
  difference between the two is that yada is asynchronous. This is
  useful when making calls to other services while handling a web
  request.<br />
<a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> now has a new Client
API. With the Client API a Datomic database can be accessed as a
service, in a more idiomatic Clojure style than its old REST API. To
play around with yada and Datomic Client I made a wiki with it. As a
bonus the example yada project also
uses <a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a>, instead of Leiningen as
its build tool,
which I had not played around with either.</p>

<p>The code for clj-wiki is on
  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-wiki">https://github.com/thegeez/clj-wiki</a><br />
  An example wiki is (temporarily) running at <a href="http://wiki.thegeez.net">http://wiki.thegeez.net</a></p> 

<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>
  </p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/juxt/yada">yada</a> an async and
  full http Clojure web library</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/juxt/yada">Edge</a> a yada example
    web app, including configuration etc.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic Client</a> a new API
    to use with Datomic</li>
  <li><a href="https://simplemde.com/">SimpleMDE</a> a Markdown editor
    component</li>
  <li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowwoc/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/Home">google-diff-match-patch</a>
  for diffs and patches</li>
  </ul>
<br />

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>In a wiki everybody can make changes to articles and add new
  articles. In clj-wiki all the edits to an article are stored as a
  transaction in Datomic. The comment on an edit is saved as an
  attribute on the transaction. The actual content of an article at a
  particular version is stored as a plain text file in a storage
  server and a reference to it is stored in Datomic. Yada has good
  support for handling file uploads and downloads. Having both
  Datomic and the fileserver as a service shows the usefullness of
  yada being asynchronous when doing multiple requests to external services
  while handling web requests.</p>
<p>The interesting code in the clj-wiki project is in <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-wiki/blob/master/src/net/thegeez/wiki/wiki.clj">wiki.clj</a></p>

<h2>Conflict handling</h2>
<p>The difficult part in a wiki is what to do when multiple users
  try to change the same article at the same time. In clj-wiki these
  situations are detected and when they happen users are shown a
  conflict page where they have to incorporate any changes made by
  other users. No edits are ever silently overwritten or discarded.</p>
