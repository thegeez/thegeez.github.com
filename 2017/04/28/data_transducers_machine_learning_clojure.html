<p>The transducers from the <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/xforms">net.cgrand.xforms</a> library are great to
  transform and analyze data with in Clojure. This blogpost shows how
  the xforms transducers can be used to do
  data analysis for a machine learning problem from Kaggle, which is a data
  science competition platform.</p>

<p>One of the competitions on Kaggle is
  the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic
    competition</a>. For this competition you are given a dataset
  about passengers aboard the Titanic, with data such as their age and how much
  they paid for their ticket. In the training data you are also told
  if the passenger survived. The goal of the competition is to predict
  if a passenger survived or not for a test set of data.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic/titanic-data-science-solutions">tutorial</a>
  on the Kaggle site explains how to solve such a problem. The
  tutorial explains which steps to take and how to analyze, change
  or create data and how to make predictions. The
  tutorial uses Python to go through all these steps. In this blog
  we'll use Clojure instead.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the data</h2>

<pre style="width: 160%">
| :PassengerId | :SibSp |   :Fare | :Embarked |   :Sex | :Survived | :Parch | :Pclass | :Age |
|--------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------+-----------+--------+---------+------|
|            1 |      1 |    7.25 |         S |   male |         0 |      0 |       3 |   22 |
|            2 |      1 | 71.2833 |         C | female |         1 |      0 |       1 |   38 |
|            3 |      0 |   7.925 |         S | female |         1 |      0 |       3 |   26 |
|            4 |      1 |    53.1 |         S | female |         1 |      0 |       1 |   35 |
;; etc

<span>Example data from the Titanic dataset</span>

<p>Lets say you would like to find out how many people from the training
data set survived. With the functions from clojure.core that looks
like this:</p>
<textarea id="snippet-1">
(-&gt; (map :Survived data)
    frequencies)
;;=&gt; {0 549, 1 342}</textarea>

<p>And here's how to slice the data to see how many people survived based
on their gender:</p>
<textarea id="snippet-2">
(-&gt; (map (juxt :Sex :Survived) data)
    frequencies)
;;=&gt; {["male" 0] 468,
;;    ["female" 1] 233,
;;    ["female" 0] 81,
;;    ["male" 1] 109}

(let [by-sex (group-by :Sex data)
      survived (zipmap (keys by-sex)
                       (-&gt;&gt; by-sex
                            vals
                            (map #(-&gt; (map :Survived %)
                                      frequencies))))]
  survived)
;;=&gt; {"male" {0 468, 1 109},
;;    "female" {1 233, 0 81}}

(reduce
 (fn [acc {:keys [Sex Survived] :as row}]
   (update-in acc [Sex Survived] (fnil inc 0)))
 {}
 data)
;;=&gt; {"male" {0 468, 1 109},
;;    "female" {1 233, 0 81}}</textarea>
<p>With the 'by-key' transducer that looks like:</p>
<textarea id="snippet-3">
(require '[net.cgrand.xforms :as x])
(into {}
      (x/by-key :Sex
                (comp (x/by-key :Survived
                                x/count)
                      (x/into {})))
      data)
;; =&gt; {"male" {0 468, 1 109},
;;     "female" {1 233, 0 81}}</textarea>

<p>For this counting use case there is little difference between using a transducer or the basic clojure.core functions. And the benefits of
  transducers being useable for different types of data, such as on
  streams is not relevant for our use case.</p>
<p>But when you want to get multiple results per grouping or
  statistics other than counting, the transducer approach with xforms
  starts to come out ahead:</p>

<textarea id="snippet-4">
(def xFrequencies (comp (x/by-key identity
                                  x/count)
                        (x/into {})))
(into {}
      (x/by-key :Sex
                :Survived
                (x/transjuxt {:chance (comp x/avg
                                            (map double))
                              :counts xFrequencies}))
      data)
;; {"male" {:chance 0.1889081455805893, :counts {0 468, 1 109}},
;;  "female" {:chance 0.7420382165605096, :counts {1 233, 0 81}}}</textarea>
<p>Or for the distribution of the Age feature in the dataset:</p>
<textarea id="snippet-5">
(def ageStats
  (comp (map :Age)
        (filter identity) ;; some Age values are missing
        (x/transjuxt {:mean (comp x/avg
                                  (map double))
                      :std-dev x/sd})))
(into {}
      ageStats
      data)
;;=&gt; {:mean 29.69911764705882, :std-dev 14.526497332334035}

(into {}
      (x/by-key :Sex
                ageStats)
      data)
;;=&gt; {"male" {:mean 30.72664459161148, :std-dev 14.678200823816606},
;;    "female" {:mean 27.915708812260537, :std-dev 14.110146457544133}}</textarea>

<p>With the xforms transducers all the data analysis from the Titanic
  tutorial in Python is as easy to do in Clojure. So the next time you
  need to do some group-by type operation, you should check out the
  transducers from net.cgrand.xforms.</p>

<p>To replicate (most of) the charts from the tutorial you can use the <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a> library.</p>

<h2>Predicting the test data</h2>
<p>The fun part of doing machine learning is having a model to make
  predictions with. For this we'll use <a href="https://github.com/joshuaeckroth/clj-ml">clj-ml</a>, which is a wrapper
  around the <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> library.</p>

<textarea id="snippet-6">
;; dataset is our data in the Weka format
(let [random-forest (doto (cm-classifiers/make-classifier :decision-tree :random-forest)
                      (.setNumTrees 100))
      trained (cm-classifiers/classifier-train random-forest dataset)]
  (let [evaluate (cm-classifiers/classifier-evaluate random-forest :cross-validation dataset 10)]
    (pprint/pprint evaluate))

  (predict test-data random-forest "data/randomforest.csv")
