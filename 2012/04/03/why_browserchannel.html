<p>After the release
  of <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-browserchannel-demo">clj-browserchannel-demo</a>,
  I have been asked what BrowserChannel is exactly. This post will
  hopefully clarify what BrowserChannel is and why it is a great fit
  for ClojureScript and Clojure web applications.</p>

<p><a href="http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn-history/r144/docs/closure_goog_net_browserchannel.js.html">BrowserChannel</a> is a protocol developed by Google. It provides cross-browser compatible, real-time, bi-directional communication
  for various Google web apps, including Google Docs and GMail.</p>

<p>An important part of this definition is the <b>bi-directional</b>
  communication. The client can send messages to the server and
  the server can send messages to the client. Canonical examples
  that require these types of communication are chat applications and
  stock/news tickers. In a chat app the client can send
  something to the server and whenever somebody else says something
  this needs to be pushed to all the clients. A stock ticker might not
  need the client to send stuff to the server, but the server needs to
  be able to constantly push messages to the client. This
  bi-directional communication is more elaborate than just AJAX
  request that don't need a page refresh. An example of
  uni-directional client-&gt;server communication is the <a href="http://clojurescriptone.com/">ClojureScriptOne</a>
  example application.</p>

<p>Similar bi-directional communication functionality is provided by
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet">Comet</a> libraries,
  <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>, <a href="http://sockjs.org">Sock.js</a>
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>.</p>

<p>For ClojureScript and Clojure web apps that need bi-directional
  communication BrowserChannel is a good fit. The client side part of
  BrowserChannel is part of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/library/">Google Closure Library</a> and
  ClojureScript leverages the Google Closure compiler and library
  extensively already. In the clj-browserchannel-demo this good fit
  shows by the
  few <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-browserchannel-demo/blob/master/cljs/bc/core.cljs">lines</a>
  of ClojureScript that are required. There are no external JavaScript
  dependencies besides the Closure library. The server side portion of
  BrowserChannel has not been open-sourced. clj-browserchannel-demo
  fills this hole with an <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-browserchannel-demo/blob/master/src/net/thegeez/browserchannel.clj">implementation</a> in Clojure.</p>

<h2>WebSockets</h2>
<p>WebSockets will ultimately replace BrowserChannel completely, as it
  serves the exact same purpose. But WebSockets is under heavy
  development and constant change. Therefore very few clients properly
  support WebSockets. BrowserChannel delivers the functionality right
  now, with support on almost every client imaginable, including
  Internet Explorer 5.5+. I know of only one shop that used WebSockets
  in production and they dropped support for WebSockets after users
  reported problems, mostly behind firewalls.</p>

<p>BrowserChannel is a pragmatic alternative to WebSockets that works on
many clients today:
</p><ul>
<li>XHR connections or forever iframes for Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Both in streaming and non-streaming versions</li>
<li>Explicit testing for buffering problems on the connection</li>
<li>Cross domain possible by using XPC</li>
<li>Work around for connection limits to the same domain</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost over WebSockets is the overhead of requiring more requests between the client and server.</p>

<h2>The punchline</h2>
<p>Of course the question is if BrowserChannel is production ready: open
firebug, goto gmail.com and look for the GET and POST requests to
  /channel/test?VER=8 and /channel/bind?VER=8:</p>
