  <div id="content"><h1 id="post-title">BrowserChannel and the Rijksmuseum API at
  The Next Web HackBattle</h1>16 May 2012

<p>The
  last <a href="http://thenextweb.com/conference/amsterdam/2012/">The
  Next Web conference</a> in Amsterdam on the 23rd to 25th of April
  2012 included a two
  day <a href="http://thenextweb.com/conference/amsterdam/2012/hackbattle">HackBattle</a>. During
  this HackBattle I built a website combining the API from the
  <a href="http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api">Rijksmuseum</a> with my
  <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-browserchannel">clj-browserchannel</a>
  library.</p>

<p>The Rijksmuseum API contains all the works from the museum in
  digital format, with loads of metadata. The website I build displays
  a selection from these works and allows people to add 'notes' to the
  paintings. When a note is placed, everybody looking at that painting
  will see the note pop-up on the site. The idea behind this was that
  this could be used in a group tour setting through the museum. Of
  course the real-time aspect of the website is provided by
  clj-browserchannel. This group tour aspect is also the motivation
  behind the simple design of the website, which makes it usable on at
  least Android smartphones.

<h2>How big?!</h2>
<p>Part of the metadata of a painting is its size. Rather than just
  including this information in text, the website has a 'How big?!'
  button. When 'How big?!' is enabled a painting is shown with a
  common object as an overlay, in the proper scale. This is meant to
  communicate the real-life size of the work. For smaller paintings a soccer
  ball is used for the comparison. The large 'Nachtwacht' by Rembrandt uses a
  Dutch bicycle to show its dimensions.</p>

<p>This project made me able to complete my goal for the conference:
  plugging Clojure on stage. This was done during the 1-minute presentations of the HackBattle entries on stage in the Green Room.</p>

<p>The code is

  thanks to the kind people from TNW and the Rijksmuseum for
  organizing the HackBattle.</p>
