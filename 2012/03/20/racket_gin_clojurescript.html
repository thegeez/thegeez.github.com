<p>A ClojureScript implementation of a simple card game. The game can
  be played <a href="http://thegeez-gin.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Racket programming environment comes with a couple of example
  games written in Scheme. My favorite of these games is Gin
  Rummy. The object of this game is to make a hand of 10 cards,
  consisting of a set of four cards and two sets of three cards. A set
  of cards are cards of the same rank (i.e. three Jacks) or subsequent
  cards of the same suit (i.e. 8,9,10,J of hearts). An ace can be low
  or high. The game has two players with ten cards each. In the middle
  are the deck of cards faced down and a discard pile, with cards face
  up. Players take turns and can choose to pick to top card of the
  discard pile or a face down card from the deck. The chosen card has
  to be exchanged for a card in the players hand, which is placed on
  top of the discard pile. For more information see the
  <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/games/ginrummy.html"> Racket documentation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thegeez/cljs-gin">cljs-gin</a> is an
  implementation of Gin Rummy in ClojureScript. The games runs
  completely in the browser. The Clojure code for the opponent is from
  a program that takes control of the mouse to play the game against
  the original Scheme client. This code worked  without change in
  ClojureScript, but its naive algorithm from the Scheme source has
  been optimized for speed in the browser. The cards are draggable
  div elements, using
  the <a href="http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/docs/class_goog_fx_Dragger.html">Dragger</a>
  class from the google closure library.</p>

<p>The game is hosted on Amazon
  S3: <a href="http://thegeez-gin.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">Gin
  Rummy</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://thegeez-gin.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/index-dev.html">development
    version</a> has a view of the table state, including the cards of
  the opponent. This is a consequence of the whole application living
  at the client. However the code is written to support communication
  with a server for a remote opponent in the future.</p> 

<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/cljs-gin">Github</a>.</p>
