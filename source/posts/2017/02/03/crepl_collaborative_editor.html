<h1 id="post-title">crepl: Write and run ClojureScript code
  together</h1>

<p><a href="http://crepl.thegeez.net">crepl</a> is a collaborative
  editor written in Clojure and ClojureScript. In the editor you can
  write and evaluate ClojureScript code. This is a fun and quick way
  to try out some ClojureScript code. The real fun begins when you
  get others to work on the same code with you by sending them the
  URL. When multiple people are working on the same code at the same
  time you will see their changes appear immediately and the output
  of running the code will be shared with everybody. crepl is like
  Google Docs that can also run ClojureScript!</p>
