<h1 id="post-title">Dutch Clojure Days 2017: crepl demo</h1>

<p>At the <a href="http://clojuredays.org/">Dutch Clojure Days</a>
  2017 in Amsterdam I gave a lightning talk about <a href="http://crepl.thegeez.net">crepl</a>. With crepl
  you can write and run ClojureScript code together. I also introduced
  <a href="http://c3e.thegeez.net">c3e</a>, which is a collaborative editor in the browser for full
  projects with multiple files. The video for the talk is
  below:</p>
