<h1 id="post-title">Rofolia: a self-hosted collaborative database/spreadsheet hybrid</h1>

<p>My latest Clojure project is now available! <a href="https://rofolia.com">Rofolia</a> is a self-hosted collaborative database/spreadsheet hybrid. It is similar to Airtable and Google Sheets and supports links between tables, lookups, formula's and API access.</p>

<p>Try the demo at <a href="https://demo.rofolia.com">demo.rofolia.com</a> and check out the documentation at <a href="https://rofolia.com">Rofolia.com</a>.</p>
