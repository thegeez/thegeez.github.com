<h1 id="post-title">Gatherlist: combining Pedestal & OAuth</h1>

<p>Visiting conferences is nice. You'll find lots of new and old
  friends and will leave with a whole list of new interesting ideas to
  follow up on. It is also an opportunity to find out how much
  browsing websites on a mobile phone sucks. Want to find today's
  schedule on the conference mobile website? Sorry, the hamburger menu doesn't collapse and blocks the
  program table. Want to find the venue address? Sorry, the hero image of
  the host city's landscape is a static overlay on top of the Google
  maps.</p>

<p>At conferences it is equally complicated to arrange an impromptu
  meeting or eating arrangement between a larger group of people. It's
  a hassle to exchange contact details with all of them, because not
  everybody is on the same platform. The most common place for
  these types of ad-hoc organizing that I have seen is on Twitter. But it's
  almost impossible to follow a conversation between a lot of people
  on Twitter, especially through the mobile website.</p>

<p><a href="https://gatherlist.herokuapp.com/">Gatherlist</a> is a
  solution to this problem. Just share the url to a page and everybody
  can add information to it.</p>

<p>Although the biggest motivation for this project is that I needed
  an excuse to combine <a href="http://pedestal.io">Pedestal</a> with
  third party oauth logins from GitHub, Twitter, Facebook and Google.</p>
