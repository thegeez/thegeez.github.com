<p>The server for <a href="/2014/06/12/gin_datomic.html">Gin Rummy
    with Datomic</a> has been shut down. Playing over the network against
  a human or AI opponent through the Datomic database is no longer
  available. See the <a href="/2014/06/12/gin_datomic.html">blog
    post</a> and code
  at <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/gin">github.com/thegeez/gin</a>
  to run the code yourself.</p>

<p>A ClojureScript-only version to play against the CLJS AI is
  available here: <a href="/static/gin-static/lobby.html">Gin Rummy</a></p>
