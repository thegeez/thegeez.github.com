<h1 id="post-title">Solving 4clojure problems in an editor</h1>

<p>On
 Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/xeqixeqi/status/421323628190244865">xeqixeqi</a>
 asked for a leiningen template to be able to solve to the problems
 from <a href="http://www.4clojure.org">4clojure</a> in an editor rather
 than the browser. He then solved this problem himself by building a
 <a href="https://github.com/xeqi/foreclojure">lein template for
 4clojure</a>.</p>

<p>I did most of the problems in emacs by copy-pasting the
  test cases from each problem page. To turn the text on
  4clojure into a runnable test I used this
  utility: <a href="https://gist.github.com/thegeez/8352754">gist:
  4clojure in editor</a>.</p>
