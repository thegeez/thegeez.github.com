<h1 id="post-title">Trello clone clone in Clojure</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bigardone/phoenix-trello">Phoenix-Trello</a>
  project is a Trello clone build with Elixir, Pheonix and
  React. I like the dragging cards interface in Trello, so I made a
  Trello clone clone in Clojure.</p>

<p>The code for the Clojure version is on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-board">thegeez/clj-board</a>. The example is
  running on Heroku: <a href="https://clj-board.herokuapp.com">https://clj-board.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p>There are two pieces for this project that were interesting to see
  how well they would work in Clojure. The first is combining Drag and
  Drop support with React in ClojureScript. The second is to structure
  the front-end following the Redux/Flux approach.</p>

<p>The Drag and Drop support comes from
  the <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd">React DnD</a>
  library. The interop support in <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a> works good enough to make it
  work in ClojureScript.</p>

<p>The Phoenix-Trello project uses a Redux/Flux approach to organizing
  the React front-end. In <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">Redux</a> there is a single source of
  state in the application. This is similar to how most ClojureScript
  React libraries work, such as Om and Reagent. However with Redux
  the rendering code is expressed as always rendering the whole
  state. Most ClojureScript React libraries have optimisations to only
  update parts of the interface when sub-parts of the state
  change. It turns out that using the Redux approach also works good
  enough for this project. The optimalisations and extra complexity
  in ClojureScript React libraries turned out to not be needed for
  this project. The single
  state in this project is build around <a href="https://github.com/Day8/re-frame">re-frame</a>, but using only a
  single subscription instead of multiple more fine-grained state observers.</p>
