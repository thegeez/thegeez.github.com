<p>At the <a href="http://www.ticketbase.com/events/dutch-clojure-days-2016">Dutch Clojure Days</a> 2016 in Amsterdam I gave a presentation on building
  user facing web applications with Pedestal. The video for it is

 <p>The example application from the presentation is a basic app for
 posting links and leaving comments, with login support with
 oAuth. This application is on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/thecljvector">thecljvector</a></p>
