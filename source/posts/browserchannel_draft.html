What is goog.net.BrowserChannel?

Since releasing clj-browserchannel-demo people have asked and are
confused what it is

AJAX question/answer

COMET/Server puch notification

the canonical example is chat. A one way server -> client connection
is a stock ticker or news page.

THe stack
Cljs              Clj
Closure           Server
BrowserChannel    ?

As a wise man said. Clojure Rocks, JavaScript Reaches. For single page
webapps a way 

No javascript dependencies outside the Google Closure Library.

Two transports XHR and IE forever frames
Streaming and non streaming

* cross domain support with xpc
* work around connection limits to the same domain. For instance for
people that have many tabs open with documents from Google Docs.

WebSockets?
In an ideal world we would only have websockets.
As XKCD duly noted: n+1 standards.
I know of one nodejs shop that ran WebSockets in production. They
dropped support for websockets after users reported connection
problems, particularly behind firewalls. WebSockets is is heavy
development. BrowserChannel is about working now and everywhere. For
now the pragmatic choice is to skip WebSockets. It is certainly out of
scope for the clj-browserchannel project. The trade is ofcourse that
websockets has less overhead due to requiring less full requests to
the server.

The punchline
Of course the question is if goog.net.BrowserChannel is production
ready.

Open firebug, goto GMail and look for the GET and POST request the
/channel/test and /channel/bind
