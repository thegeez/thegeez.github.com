<h1 id="post-title">Serverless collaboration</h1>

<p>Previously I've worked on a collaborative tool, which worked like Google Docs. This project was
  called <a href="/2017/02/11/crepl_atom_sync.html">crepl</a>. Because
  I stopped paying for hosting of its server, that project is now
  offline. That made me consider: what if a collaborative editor wouldn't need a
  server?</p>

<p>The server in crepl was needed to handle the connections between all
  the clients and the algorithm for collaborative editing
  needed a central server. For both there are alternatives that do not
  need a server.</p>

<p>Browsers can connect to eachother over a network without a central
  server using WebRTC, of which there is a nice
  example <a href="https://github.com/owebio/serverless-webrtc-chat">here</a>. This
  works well on local networks with modern browsers. Through firewalls
  and older browser this is less likely to work.</p>

<p>Crepl uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Operational Transformation</a> and needs a central server
  for correctness. Algorithms for collaborative editing that do not
  need a central servers can be found in
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">conflict-free
  replicated data type (CRDT)</a> research. Through the excellent
  <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge">Automerge</a> project I found the RGA algorithm.</p>


<p><a href="/static/cljs-collab/index.html">Cljs-collab</a> is the beginnings of a serverless collaboration system,
  which works between two browsers. It is a single page with all the
  logic in the client javascript, which is downloaded as a single
  file.</p>

<p>This project is serverless by not requiring any server after
  downloading the page. That's even fewer servers than most serverless
  systems.</p>
