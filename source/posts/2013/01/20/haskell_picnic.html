<h1 id="post-title">Haskell Picnic</h1>

<p><a href="http://lisperati.com/haskell/">PicnicMob</a> is a Haskell
  tutorial for beginners. It is different from many other
  introductory tutorials as it has an interesting,
non-trivial algorithm as the subject and it produces pictures at every
step. Also you can't go wrong by reading something by Conrad Barski,
author of <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a>.</p>

<p>I worked through the tutorial when I was still at university. The
  picnic placement pictures I first generated are from 2009. I
  revisited the tutorial to read up on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a>
  algorithm that is used. Along the way I ported the code to Clojure and this code
  is on GitHub <a href="https://gist.github.com/4580548">here</a>. The Clojure code follows the Haskell code quite
  closely. As with the original tutorial the Clojure code is
  inefficient with its use of datastructures and its algorithmic complexity.</p>


<p>At the end of the tutorial is a final <a href="http://lisperati.com/haskell/ht13.html">thought</a> by Barski on
  similation of the physical world and how to represented or model
  this world. Barsky refers to interesting work in this area by Jeff
Hawkins at a company called <a href="https://www.numenta.com/">Numenta</a>. A presentation by Jeff Hawkins
about this work has been recorded at the 2012 Strange Loop conference and
is available at InfoQ. With a title <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Brain-Computing">"Computing Like the Brain"</a> there's
no reason not to watch it. The presentation is a mix of interesting
theory, an actual implementation and enthousiasm, that leaves me with
the (unrealistic) desire to implement such software. A similarly
exciting presentation is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ1qgCr09j8">"Machine Learning Live"</a> by Mike Anderson from
the 2012 Clojure Conj about neural networks.</p>
