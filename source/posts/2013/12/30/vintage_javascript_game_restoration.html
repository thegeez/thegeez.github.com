<h1 id="post-title">Vintage JavaScript game restoration</h1>

<p>At a recent <a href="http://amsclj.nl/">Amsterdam Clojurians meetup</a> the topic was game
  development. Some of the first code I played around with in high school were games
  in JavaScript. These games were great as an introduction to programming
  because all that is needed to play around with them is a browser, 'view source' and
  notepad. My favorite JavaScript games then were made by
  K. Moriyama. His site from 1996 is still available online today in
  its original
  form: <a href="http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~jimmeans/">K. Moriyama's
  Home Page</a>, including a matrix led visitor counter and gradient
  word-art like header.</p>

<p>Mr. Moriyama took great care to make sure his games were playable
  on most browsers, including Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape
  Navigator 3. Sadly, current browsers cannot run the JavaScript
  anymore. The game I like most
  is <a href="http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~jimmeans/falcon/">JS
  Falcon</a>. To be able to play this game again I have dusted of the
  old JavaScript. All that needed changing were some DOM traversal
  paths and the main loop's update interval. The server-side high
  score bookkeeping has been removed from this version.</p>

<p>JS Falcon below works again in Chrome (at least version 30+):</p>

<p>Of course the inner workings of this game are available through
  right click and 'view source'.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~jimmeans/game03w.htm">Invader-like game</a> by K. Moriyama that only uses ASCII in a textarea
  still works today!</p>
