<h1 id="post-title">Databrowser for Crux</h1>

<p>Databrowser is a web app to explore the data in a <a href="https://www.opencrux.com">Crux</a> database. It takes a lot of inspiration from the <a href="https://github.com/cognitect-labs/REBL-distro">REBL</a> tool, with added features for Crux documents, such as an easy way to enter time and dates and to view diffs. Here's a longer list of features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write custom queries</li>
<li>Add Clojure code to your queries to shape the data</li>
<li>Support for collections of heterogeneous data</li>
<li>Group and sort the data in grids</li>
<li>Browse and view pane (similar to REBL)</li>
<li>Drill down into data through navigation</li>
<li>Full keyboard navigation support</li>
<li>Support for easy creation of time and date instances for bi-temporal queries</li>
<li>Support to view diffs of data</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an example running on <a href="http://databrowser.thegeez.net">http://databrowser.thegeez.net</a> with a Crux database with some example data from a Crux tutorial.</p>

<p>Databrowser is available as a stand-alone jar file that can be included in a Crux topology to run along side your Crux database. The jar and instructions to do so are available on  <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/databrowser">https://github.com/thegeez/databrowser</a></p>
