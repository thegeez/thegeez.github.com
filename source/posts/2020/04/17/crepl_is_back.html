<h1 id="post-title">Collaborate serverless-ly on ClojureScript: crepl is back</h1>

<p><a href="https://crepl.thegeez.net">crepl</a> is a collaborative
  editor written in Clojure and ClojureScript. In the editor you can
  write and evaluate ClojureScript code. And you can work on the same code together, similar to Google Docs. crepl has been offline for quite some time as I did not have a place to deploy it to. Recently, I have been playing around with compiling Clojure with GraalVM's native-image and deploying on AWS Lambda. Because AWS Lambda works together with websockets via API Gateway the whole crepl infrastructure can be deployed in a serverless manner too!</p>

<p>Try out the serverless crepl here: <a href="https://crepl.thegeez.net">crepl.thegeez.net</a></p>
