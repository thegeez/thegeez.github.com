  <div id="content"><h1 id="post-title">Gin Rummy with Datomic</h1>12 Jun 2014

<p>When I began to learn Clojure I found the <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/games/ginrummy.html">Gin Rummy</a> game in the <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">PLT
  Racket/Scheme</a> programming environment. Gin is a simple card game and
  it includes a simple AI for an opponent. This game has been the
  basis for some previous hobby projects, specifically a <a href="/2012/03/20/racket_gin_clojurescript.html">ClojureScript
  implementation</a> and
  a <a href="/2012/06/01/ginbot_euroclojure.html">software robot</a>
  to play the game. But the project I always wanted to make was a way
  to play Gin over the internet. Some 5 years later it is finally
  done:</p>

<p>At <a href="http://gin.thegeez.net/">gin.thegeez.net</a> you can
  play the Gin card game against a ClojureScript AI, a remote Clojure AI or a remote human opponent.</p>


<p>The code for the project is
  at <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/gin">github.com/thegeez/gin</a></p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Gin is a web application with Clojure on the server and
  ClojureScript in the browser. In the middle of the architecture is a
  <a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> database. Datomic
  transactions and listening to the changes in the database via the transaction report queue are the fundamental interactions in the
  application. On the client-side <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/">DataScript</a> is used to keep to
  drawing, AI and communication components separate.</p>
<p><img width="570" src="/images/gin_arch.png" /></p>


<h2>Round trip of a single move</h2>

<p>Suppose we are playing against a human opponent and it is our turn
  to make a move. We decide to take a card from the pile, which is a
  card that is face down. Once we dragged that card to our hand the UI
  will transact this event into the DataScript database. The
  communication service sees this transaction report and sends an AJAX
  request to the game server for this event. The response for this
  AJAX request is not used, unless an error occurred. Later, via
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">Server-Sent Events</a> (SSE), the client will be notified of updates if there
  were any. On the server side the event is transacted into the
  Datomic database. All the listening components on the server are
  notified of the update via the transaction report queue. For the two
  human opponents this means a message will be sent via SSE. Perhaps
  the dealer component on the server decides to transact a shuffle
  when the pile has been exhausted. When an event comes in on the
  client that event is transacted into the DataScript store. Then
  the entire game is re-rendered, which will start the animations.
  The message that is sent to either client might be different, because
  an opponent should not be told what the cards are that its opponent
  got or has.</p>

<h2>Gin in Datomic</h2>
<p>Gin is a turn-based card game. The game is a sequence of events of
  taking or discarding a card and at every point in the game every
  card is somewhere on the table, either in the hand of a player or in
  the pile or stack of discards. With Datomic all the events are a
  transaction and the entire state before and after each transaction
  is readily available. Having both the history of the sequence of
  events available and the whole state at each point in time is pretty
  great. For instance when a player has discarded a card, the event
  only contains which card this player took from his hand. Based on
  the event the dealer will receive the transaction and will need to
  look at all the cards to see if there is a winner. Because both the
  sequence of events and the whole current state are always needed it
  is nice that they do not need to be derived from each other which
  can be complicated or even impossible.</p>

<a name="stream-from"></a>
<h2>Reconstructing the transaction queue with stream-from</h2>
<p>The communication between the server and the client is a stream of
  events based on the transaction queue. Of course this connection is
  subject to reconnects. Therefore this stream needs to be able to be
  joined from any point in time. Consider the case for instance where
  a client reconnects to a different web-server that as a Datomic peer
  has not yet seen
  all the transactions yet. Or a client reconnects and needs to see
  transactions that have already passed through
  the <a href="http://docs.datomic.com/clojure/#datomic.api/tx-report-queue">transaction
  report queue</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/gin/blob/master/src/gin/system/database_datomic.clj#L169">stream-from</a> function is meant to cover these
  cases. stream-from provides a stream of transaction reports from a
  tx t, where this t can be earlier or later than the t currently
  available in the peer. A more elaborate set-up should perhaps move
  the transaction report queue into a
separate
<a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">log</a>.</p>

<h2>core.async</h2>
<p>Datomic provides a single tx-report-queue. Gin has multiple consumers
of this queue; the dealer process, the AI process and every
client server-sent events connection. Providing multiple copies of
  this stream is done with
  a <a href="http://clojure.github.io/core.async/#clojure.core.async/mult">mult</a>
  from core.async. Each copy of the stream is used as a 1-to-1
  channel, while core.async channels are many-to-many channels
  (technically core.async does not care but certainly does not assume
  1-to-1 usage). When a server-sent events connection is closed I use
  backward 'close!' propagation to manage the 'mult'. However backward
  'close!' propagation does not work with the many-to-many nature of
core.async. So I couldn't reuse 'mapcat&gt;' and other operations. Because
these operations will close the output when the input closes, but not the input
when the output closes. This means the code has some go-loop's where
library functions would have been nicer.</p>

<h2>Client with ClojureScript</h2>

<p>The biggest reason this project took a while to complete was that I
  was never quite sure how to do the client side. I had already made a
ClojureScript <a href="/2012/03/20/racket_gin_clojurescript.html">version</a>
  but that one did not include client-server communication. The
  missing piece
  was <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/">DataScript</a>.
  DataScript is a much better storage for state than an
  atom+watcher combination. As with Datomic on the server side it is
  very nice to have both the sequence of events or latest event
  available, as well as the entire current state. The client-server
  communication is usually only interested in the last event, while
  the UI component needs the entire state to redraw everything.
  Because all the components only talk and listen to DataScript I
  could develop the new game UI while running a ClojureScript AI as an
  opponent. Adding the client-server communication did not impact the
  other components. Putting the data store in the middle of the
  client-side architecture is a lot like
  the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html">Flux</a>
  idea. Most client-side architectures have at least 2 components that
  are best kept separate; at least one UI component and a
  communication component.</p> 

<h2>Animation</h2>
<p>The animation of the moving cards in the game is done
  like <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> but not
  with React.js. After each transaction the whole game is redraw by
  initializing an animation for every card to the position it now
  needs to be. If a card is already where it needs to be this
  animation is not done. Most importantly this supports redrawing the
  game while animations from the previous event are still in
  progress.</p>

<h2>Server-Sent Events</h2>
<p>Another reason this project took long to finish were some detour
  projects. As a card game Gin requires notifications from the server to
  the client when the opponent makes a move. There are many ways to do
  this, but most of these approaches were very opaque to me or
  required server-side implementations that do not work well with
  Clojure or simply had no Clojure implementation available. One of
  the alternatives I pursued was <a href="http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn-history/r144/docs/closure_goog_net_browserchannel.js.html">BrowserChannel</a>, which is a
  WebSocket-like functionality
  in <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/library/">goog
  closure</a>. I created an implementation for the server-side
  component for BrowserChannel in Clojure
  with <a href="https://github.com/diligenceengine/clj-browserchannel">clj-browserchannel</a>,
  as described <a href="/2012/04/03/why_browserchannel.html">here</a>,
  <a href="/2012/05/16/the_next_web_rijksmuseum.html">here</a>
  and <a href="/2012/07/10/test_selenium_browserchannel.html">here</a>.
Both WebSockets and BrowserChannel provide bi-directional
  communication between a browser and a server. It turned out that
  using Server-Sent Events was much simpler. Server-Sent Events only
  provides one directional server-client communication, but for the
  client-server communication we can just use regular AJAX constructs.
  This also means that the server code is just handling requests
  rather than having to shuffle all the code into a single
  bi-directional handler.
  The key to Server-Sent Events is that it will send along the last-event-id that has been received when it automatically reconnects.
  For the Gin game the last-event-id is the t of the Datomic database,
  which uniquely identifies the current state. This is also the
  motivation for the <a href="#stream-from">stream-from</a> function mentioned earlier.
  Server-Sent Events is not supported by all browsers. For Gin I use
  the <a href="https://github.com/amvtek/EventSource">AmvTek
  EventSource polyfill</a>. Due to my server-side code Gin only supports modern
  browsers and IE10 or better.
 </p>

<h2>Resilience</h2>
<p>A million things can go wrong while running a web application. Therefore
  the Gin game always supports reloading the page. This will
  reconstruct the game state where it left off.</p>

<h2>Scalability</h2>
<p>Currently the demo is deployed on a single instance. But
  architecturally there is nothing that would prevent a deployment
  behind a load-balancer with multiple, rotating instances. For this the Datomic part would need a persistent storage and a stand-alone transactor.
  Also the dealer and AI components would need to be run on a
  dedicated instance. It would be quite easy to run these separately
  because of the <a href="https://github.com/stuartsierra/component">component</a> library.</p>

<h2>Web application with Clojure</h2><h2>
</h2><p>Another detour project was to sort out how to develop and deploy a
  complete web application with Clojure, with persistence, templates
  and authentication. This work ended up in
  <a href="https://github.com/thegeez/clj-crud">clj-crud</a> and is
  described <a href="/2014/04/30/datascript_clojure_web_app.html">here</a>.
